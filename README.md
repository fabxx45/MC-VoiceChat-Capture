repo creation 2/4
 
Steps:
1. install jna-5.13.0.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/jna/jna/
2. install voicechat-forge-1.21.4-2.5.26.jar https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat/download/5966002
3. install vosk-0.3.45.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/alphacephei/vosk/0.3.45/vosk-0.3.45.jar
4. install vosk-model

add all to the directory of the main folder

What you also need to do is to add the 3 things (all except for vosk-model) you downloaded to the libaries and activiate the modules afterwards.

Then if you run it should work only problem is that it doesn't except the current audio file but that is not important because you will change it later.

Need to set the folder direction for vosk jar file current templet is for windows only.
