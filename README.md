repo creation 2/4
 
Steps:
install jna-5.13.0.jar
install voicechat-forge-1.21.4-2.5.26.jar
install vosk-0.3.45.jar

add all to the directory of the main folder

What you also need to do is to add the 3 things you downloaded to the libaries and activiate the modules afterwards

Then if you run it should work only problem is that it doesn't except the current audio file but that is not important because you will change it later
